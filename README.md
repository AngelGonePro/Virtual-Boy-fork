## About Virtual Boy 
Virtual Boy is a discord theme based on a failed games console by Nintendo of the same name. It sports an amoled background and red accents. 

## Dont like the colors? No Worries!
By default, the theme has a red accent, faithful to the graphics of the original Virtual Boy system. However, these colors can be swapped for any color the user desires.
Just change these two values to match the color to your liking!

## Why did you make this theme?
This is my first ever properly finished Discord Theme. I made it cuz I was working on a previous theme with an ex partner of mine, but that project died off due to a breakup. I really wanted to make my own theme though, so I set out to make this.

## Can I modify this theme for personal use?
Yes, BUT. if you want to publish it, I kindly ask of you to link back to this repository, and make sure people know its based of this. Also make sure the credits below are clearly shown!

## Contribution?
