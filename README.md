## Why this theme? 
This theme originally started out as a simple collection of small CSS snipets. In memory of a previous relationship, with whom I used to maintain a theme together, I wanted to invest more time into my own.
This theme was originally meant to be for personal use only, but I figured it would be easier to maintain via github. So I decided to release it.

## Dont like the colors? No Worries!
Just change these two values to match the color to your liking!

## Can I modify this theme for personal use?
Yes, BUT. if you want to publish it, I kindly ask of you to link back to this repository, and make sure people know its based of this. But honestly, why would you. Its pretty ugly.
